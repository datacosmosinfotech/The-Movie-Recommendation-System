# 🎬 MOVIE RECOMMENDATION SYSTEM

## 📌 PROJECT OVERVIEW

The Movie Recommendation System is a machine learning–based application that suggests movies to users based on their interests. This project uses a content-based filtering approach, where recommendations are generated by analyzing movie features such as genres, keywords, cast, and overview. The application is developed using Python and deployed with Streamlit.

## ⚙️ HOW IT WORKS

Movie data is preprocessed and important features are combined.

Similarity between movies is calculated using cosine similarity.

When a user selects a movie, the system recommends similar movies.

Movie posters are fetched using the TMDB API.

Results are displayed through a Streamlit interface.

## 🚀 HOW TO RUN THE PROJECT
### ✔️Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-username/movie-recommendation-system.git

### ✔️Move into the project directory
cd movie-recommendation-system

### ✔️Install required dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

### ✔️Run the Streamlit application
streamlit run app.py

## ✅ FEATURES

Content based movie recommendation

Interactive Streamlit UI

Real time movie poster display

Beginner friendly implementation


## 📌 CONCLUSION

The Movie Recommendation System demonstrates how machine learning techniques can be applied to recommend movies based on content similarity. 

This project covers the complete workflow from data preprocessing to model deployment,

making it a strong data science project.

## 🔮 FUTURE SCOPE

Add user ratings and feedback

Implement collaborative filtering

Improve recommendation accuracy

Deploy on cloud platforms

Extend to a mobile application

## ⭐ ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS

I would like to thank TMDB for providing movie data and posters. I also acknowledge the use of open source Python libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, and Streamlit.
